# Campus Event Reporting System

A comprehensive web-based system for managing campus events, student registrations, attendance tracking, and feedback collection. Built with FastAPI and featuring an interactive SQL query interface.

## My Approach
whenever we hear Campus Events, the first thing comes to mind is Students , Events, Free Attedance, Registation. For areposrting System Firstly I would like to make the tables for the all the data like, Student information, College information, registration Number,ect.

Sqlite is very easy and can be easily implmented using python,we would use sqlite to store and handle the data.

I would build a system which to track and analyse the campus events and participation.

#### *I would also concentrate on analytics and reporting capablities of the project.*

## Funtionalitys

I would concentrate on the core funtionalities like:
1. Event management.
2. Student Registration.
3. attendence Tracking.
4. Feedback Collection.

5. Also making sure that the UI is very simple and can be easily navigated.

## Whether I follow and Deviate from AI Suggestions:
•	I really love how ChatGPT comes up with a well-executable plan, and the assumptions were all the necessary things which we should keep in mind while creating a project of this sort.

•	AI suggestions were really great in terms of planning and guidance.

•	I deviate a few times when I kind of think AI is not being creative anywhere. Creativity is one of the major factors for a website or an app to be attractive, but with the apps and websites created by these LL.M. models, they are not that creative.
